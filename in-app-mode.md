!! Notice !!

Normaly you can create a reporting in seperate app f.e.: "myApp-task" that have an connected appID to the origin app.


The not regular way is: to create the settings directly in the origin app and you connected to yourself appid! 
But this is not a regular way to use! 


If you use the in app mode please set the "ReloadTimeout" for example "30" ... please check your loadScript time and set that to your time that you need for.
